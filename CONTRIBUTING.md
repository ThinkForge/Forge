# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. Most issues
other than bugs should exist for the project already if they are in scope; make sure to look there
first.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Implement your changes. Remember to include testing that adequately covers your code,
    if applicable. PRs with no testing added need to have made minimal changes to be accepted.
2. Update the documentation site with details of changes to the project, in the appropriate area.
    If you need assistance with this, create an issue with the [docs] and [help wanted] tags.
    Documentation should be a separate PR, and the maintainer can use mkdocs to deploy them.
3. Ensure your changes pass the automatic tests from Appveyor.
4. Your PR will be merged in once you have the sign-off with the project maintainer, in order to
    maintain a consistent release schedule. If the maintainer does not approve or leave feedback
    on your PR, reaching out through the Discord is recommended.
