## 🗒 Description

Forge is a language designed with the structure and syntax of Elixir as a basis, with the intention of being compiled into WebAssembly. The end goal is to power a web framework that will have the same code style as an Elixir backend, making the development workflow much cleaner.

[See the docs for more information](https://thinkforge.github.io/Forge/).

## 🚀 Specification Overview

The [Specification Overview](https://thinkforge.github.io/Forge/Specification/overview/) contains the main goals that we plan to reach syntactically. This should provide enough information in the short term to give you an idea of what we want to achieve.

## ✨ Contributing

We welcome contributions! Forge is currently very much at the ALPHA stage, with very little actually working. However, we try to mark any issues with the tag "Good First Issue" if we think they could be handled by a newer contributor. On the other hand, feel free to jump right in to any issue if you think you can handle it! Just make sure to follow the [contributing](https://github.com/ThinkForge/forge/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide when you do, and things will work out fine.

## 📌 Requirements

Only Node 8+ is supported, and we use Yarn for our package management. Other than that, it should all be handled for you.
